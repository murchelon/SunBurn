# SunBurn
 Game created in 1 week for the "I cant draw but want to make a game (again)" Game Jam !  The ideia is make a game with focus on the game play and none on the graphics.  All images were hand drawn by my sun and doughter!  Link of the game jam: https://itch.io/jam/i-cant-draw-but-want-to-make-a-game-again
